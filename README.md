# miniProjectBioinformatics
This mini project is about finding the probability  functionality of a certain gene , based on known genes.

I had large data base of bacteria's gene (cog_words_bac.txt) organized in lines and another data base of each "cog" that reprasents each gene (COG_INFO_TABLE.txt).
In this project , I was required to conclude in a certain probability , what is the functionality of a specific gene , regarding to the data base I had.
I found what relitionships based on the distance, the frequent and the different genoms between the desired gene and other genes in the data base.
Base on it , I could say some information about the desired gene .
